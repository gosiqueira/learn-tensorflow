"""
Save and load models
---
Model progress can be saved during and after training. This means a model can resume where
it left off and avoid long training times. Saving also means you can share your model and
others can recreate your work. When publishing research models and techniques, most machine
learning practitioners share:
    * code to create the model, and
    * the trained weights, or parameters, for the model
Sharing this data helps others understand how the model works and try it themselves with new data.
